- **Impact**: Profile creation now works correctly

#### 2. **Missing Database Fields** ‚úÖ FIXED

- **Issue**: UserProfile model missing `preferred_language` and `timezone` fields
- **Fix Applied**: Added missing fields to UserProfile model and created migration
- **Impact**: UserProfile creation now works with all required fields

#### 3. **AgentCustomer Model Field Mapping** ‚úÖ FIXED

- **Issue**: Test was using incorrect field name (`notes` instead of `relationship_notes`)
- **Fix Applied**: Updated test to use correct field names from AgentCustomer model
- **Impact**: Agent-customer relationship creation now works correctly

#### 4. **Django Settings Configuration** ‚úÖ FIXED

- **Issue**: ALLOWED_HOSTS didn't include 'testserver' for testing

- **Impact**: API testing configuration now properly set up

#### 5. **Database Migration Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED

- **Issue**: Database schema not updated with new model fields
- **Fix Applied**: Created and applied migration for UserProfile field additions
- **Impact**: Database schema now matches model definitions

### üîÑ PENDING ISSUES (Require Server Setup)

#### 1. **API Endpoint Testing** ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING

- **Issue**: API tests require running Django server
