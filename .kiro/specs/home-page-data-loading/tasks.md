# Implementation Plan

## Frontend Debugging and Fix Tasks

- [ ] 1. Debug TransferBookingSection Component State and Rendering



  - Check `frontend/components/home/TransferBookingSection.tsx` for state management issues
  - Verify `transferData` state is being set correctly after API call
  - Check if conditional rendering `if (!transferData) return null` is preventing display
  - Add console.log to track state changes and render conditions
  - Verify the component is not returning early due to missing data checks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [ ] 2. Fix OptimizedImage Component Image Display Issues

  - Check `frontend/components/common/OptimizedImage.tsx` for undefined src handling
  - Verify `transferData?.background_image_url` is not undefined or empty string
  - Add fallback handling for when image src is null/undefined
  - Check if image component is rendering but not visible due to CSS issues
  - Add error handling and fallback image for failed image loads
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Verify Data Structure and Props Mapping

  - Check API response structure in browser DevTools Network tab
  - Verify `transferData` object has all expected properties (title, subtitle, description, etc.)
  - Check if property names match between API response and component usage
  - Verify destructuring and property access is correct in JSX
  - Add type checking to ensure data structure matches TypeScript interface
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Fix JSX Conditional Rendering Logic

  - Review all conditional rendering statements in TransferBookingSection
  - Check if `transferData?.background_image_url || ""` is causing empty src
  - Verify boolean conditions are evaluating correctly
  - Check for any early returns that might prevent rendering
  - Add debugging logs to track which render paths are taken
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 5. Debug CSS and Layout Issues

  - Check if elements are in DOM but hidden by CSS (opacity: 0, display: none, etc.)
  - Verify z-index and positioning are not hiding content
  - Check responsive classes and breakpoint-specific hiding
  - Verify image container dimensions and overflow settings
  - Use browser DevTools to inspect element visibility and layout
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Add Comprehensive Debugging Logs

  - Add console.log statements to track data flow in TransferBookingSection
  - Log API response data structure and content
  - Log state updates and component re-renders
  - Log image URL values and OptimizedImage props
  - Add error boundaries to catch and log any rendering errors
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5_

- [ ] 7. Fix Similar Issues in Other Home Page Components

  - Check `frontend/components/home/EventsSection.tsx` for similar rendering issues
  - Check `frontend/components/home/PackageTripsSection.tsx` for data mapping problems
  - Verify all home page sections are rendering their data correctly
  - Apply same debugging and fixing approach to other components
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [ ] 8. Test and Verify Fixes
  - Test TransferBookingSection renders correctly with API data
  - Verify images display properly with valid URLs
  - Test error handling when API data is missing or malformed
  - Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes
  - Test with different data scenarios (empty data, missing images, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_
