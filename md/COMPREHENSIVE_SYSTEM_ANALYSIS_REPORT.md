└── types/
    └── cart.ts            ✅ Type-safe cart interfaces
```

### 2.2 Type Safety & Integration
```typescript
// Unified Cart Types
export type CartItem = TourCartItem | EventCartItem | TransferCartItem;

// Product-specific interfaces with proper discrimination
interface TourCartItem extends BaseCartItem {
  product_type: 'tour';
  participants: { adult: number; child: number; infant: number; };
}

interface EventCartItem extends BaseCartItem {
  product_type: 'event';
  seat_numbers: string[];
  section: string;
}

interface TransferCartItem extends BaseCartItem {
  product_type: 'transfer';
  trip_type: 'one_way' | 'round_trip';
  passenger_count: number;
}
```

## 3. Product Integration Analysis

### 3.1 Can All Products Be Added to Cart? ✅ YES

#### Tour Integration
- **✅ Supported**: Full participant-based pricing
- **✅ Features**: Age groups, variants, options, schedules
- **✅ Cart**: Handles complex pricing calculations

#### Event Integration  
- **✅ Supported**: Seat-based booking system
- **✅ Features**: Sections, ticket types, performances, capacity management
- **✅ Cart**: Seat merging, capacity validation

#### Transfer Integration
- **✅ Supported**: Route-based booking system
