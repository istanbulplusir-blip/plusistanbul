# Cart System Analysis and Fixes Report

## Executive Summary

This report details the comprehensive analysis of the Peykan Tourism cart system, identifying critical inconsistencies between frontend and backend implementations, and providing complete fixes to ensure data integrity and user experience consistency.

## Issues Identified and Fixes (Aug 2025 Refresh)

1. Preserved tour age-group pricing by respecting `skip_price_calculation` in `CartItem.save`. Cart now matches detail totals.
2. Added `distinct_items` count and aligned Navbar/Cart count to number of lines, not participants.
3. Moved auth requirement to checkout; guests can add to cart from detail pages.
4. Frontend cart UI aligned to backend fields and gained inline editing (tours) and simple modals (events/transfers).

### 1. ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Variant Pricing Logic Inconsistency**

**Issue**: The `AddToCartView` in `backend/cart/views.py` was attempting to use `variant.price_modifier` while the `TourVariant` model actually uses `base_price`.

**Impact**:

- `AttributeError` when adding tour variants to cart
- Complete failure of variant-based pricing
- Potential data corruption in cart items

**Root Cause**:

- Model field mismatch between view logic and database schema
- Missing validation in the API layer

**Fix Applied**:

```python
# Before (broken):
unit_price += variant.price_modifier

# After (fixed):
unit_price = variant.base_price
```

**Files Modified**:

- `backend/cart/views.py` (lines 66-67)

### 2. ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Session ID Generation Inconsistency**

**Issue**: Different session ID generation methods between cart creation and order creation.

**Impact**:

- Cart-to-order conversion failures
- Session cart not found during checkout
- User cart data loss

**Root Cause**:

- `orders/views.py` was calling `CartService.get_or_create_cart(request.user, request.session.session_key)` with wrong signature
- `CartService.get_or_create_cart` expects `(session_id, user=None)` parameters

**Fix Applied**:

```python
# Before (broken):
cart = CartService.get_or_create_cart(request.user, request.session.session_key)

# After (fixed):
session_id = CartService.get_session_id(request)
cart = CartService.get_or_create_cart(session_id=session_id, user=request.user)
```

**Files Modified**:

- `backend/orders/views.py` (lines 30-31)

### 3. ⚠️ **MAJOR: Dual Frontend Cart Implementation**

**Issue**: Two separate cart systems in frontend:

- `useCart` hook with complex backend sync logic
- `CartContext` with simple localStorage-only logic

**Impact**:

- Data inconsistency between cart systems
- Potential race conditions
- Developer confusion about which system to use

**Root Cause**:

- Evolution of cart system without proper refactoring
- Lack of unified cart interface

**Fix Applied**:

- Created `UnifiedCartContext.tsx` that properly syncs with backend
- Implements proper authentication-aware cart handling
- Single source of truth for cart state

**Files Created**:

- `frontend/lib/contexts/UnifiedCartContext.tsx` (new unified implementation)

### 4. ⚠️ **MAJOR: Cart Data Structure Inconsistency**

**Issue**: Frontend and backend cart item structures didn't match properly.

**Impact**:

- Data transformation errors
- Missing fields in frontend display
- Inconsistent price calculations

**Root Cause**:

- Different field names and structures between frontend and backend
- Missing proper type definitions

**Fix Applied**:

- Unified cart item interface matching backend structure
- Proper data transformation in frontend
- Consistent field mapping

### 5. ⚠️ **MODERATE: Price Calculation Inconsistency**

**Issue**: Different price calculation logic between frontend and backend.

**Impact**:

- Price discrepancies in cart display
- Checkout amount mismatches
- User trust issues

**Root Cause**:

- Frontend calculated totals differently than backend
- Missing options_total consideration in some calculations

**Fix Applied**:

- Unified price calculation logic
- Proper handling of options_total
- Consistent decimal precision
- For transfers update path, removed double-adding options to override totals

## Testing Infrastructure

### Integration Test Script Created

**File**: `backend/integration_test_cart.py`

**Features**:

- Comprehensive cart flow testing
- Session ID consistency validation
- Variant pricing verification
- Price calculation validation
- Backend-frontend sync testing

**Test Coverage**:

- User authentication and cart access
- Adding multiple variants to cart
- Cart retrieval and data integrity
- Pricing calculations
- Session management
- Error handling

## Implementation Details

### Backend Fixes

1. **Cart Views** (`backend/cart/views.py`):

   - Fixed variant pricing logic to use `base_price` instead of `price_modifier`
   - Added proper error handling for variant types
   - Improved price calculation consistency

2. **Order Views** (`backend/orders/views.py`):

   - Fixed session ID generation for cart retrieval
   - Ensured consistent cart access patterns

3. **Models** (`backend/cart/models.py`):
   - Verified proper session ID handling
   - Confirmed price calculation logic in CartItem.save()

### Frontend Fixes

1. **Unified Cart Context** (`frontend/lib/contexts/UnifiedCartContext.tsx`):

   - Single cart system replacing dual implementation
   - Proper authentication-aware backend sync

   - Error handling and retry logic
   - localStorage fallback for unauthenticated users

2. **Cart Interface**:
   - Unified `CartItem` interface matching backend structure
   - Proper field mapping and data transformation
